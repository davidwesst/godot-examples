# Godot Examples, by DW

A repository for creating examples, demos, or whatever one-off issue I am trying to document and share with others. Each branch represents a different issue, with a completely unique git history.

## Table of Contents

- [`dialogue-manager-build-error`]() - An issue I hit trying to create a GitHub Workflow for a Godot 4.2.2-csharp project where the Export step would fail, only when the [Dialogue Manager]() was included in the project.

## Development Notes

- To create a new branch, from the terminal use `git checkout --orphan <branch-name>`
- DO NOT MERGE BRANCHES
  - Each branch is created as an orphan branch with a new history. They will not merge, nor are they meant to be merged.
